#Python2 vs python3
python3.0 release on 2008
In python2, the / symbol performs what is known as classic  division, this means the decimal points are truncated.
In python3 however, a single /performs "true" division. So you get 1.5 if you had inout 3/2.
To avaoid this situation in python2 specify the numbers to be float.


from __future__ import division  >> this imports the future functionality of python 3 in python2

s[:1]  >> grab everything from first index till last in a string 's'
ex s = 'Nitish Yadav'
s[:1] = itish Yadav
This does not make any modification to the present string.

s[:3] >> upto 3, not included 3
s[:3] = 'Nit'
s[:] >>grab everything
# Grab everything, but go in steps size of 1
s[::1]
# We can use this to print a string backwards
s[::-1]
